# blit

`bgl` is like a mesh between `faiface`'s `glhf` and the `pixelgl` module from his project, `pixel`. `bgl` runs on a more modern version of opengl and is simplified and improved featuring multiple core framework changes.

There is no stable release of `blit` to date and there will be undocumented, breaking changes in the future.
